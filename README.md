# Andrew Hulse

## About me
Hi, I'm Andrew. I am studying software engineering at General Assembly, pivoting from a career in construction. I discovered a passion for coding after my car broke down and I could not get to work for 2 weeks; I filled my new free time teaching myself coding, and haven't stopped learning since. I can see artfulness in programming, as I also have a passion for poetry and music.
